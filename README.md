This is an implementation of the Unified Particle Swarm 
Optimization method, integrated with Optimal Computing Budget 
Allocation for simulation-based optimization problems, mostly with 
black-box objective functions which need re-evaluation. 

Parameters are used in the algorithm which can be fine-tuned according to 
the problem. The algorithm can be connected with stochastic simulators. 

The most common numerical optimization objective functions are implemented 
for benchmarking.
